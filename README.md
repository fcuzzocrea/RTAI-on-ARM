# RTAI-on-ARM

Beside the X86 and X86/64 architecture [RTAI](https://www.rtai.org) also
supports ARM.

Key task of this repository is to track the development of RTAI on ARM and with
this to improve the support of the ARM architecture in RTAI.

To achieve that goal this repository intends to be the home of several ARM
related patches, including development patches as well as patches which are
already integrated into RTAI. Documentation (mainly via the
[Wiki](https://github.com/tko79/RTAI-on-ARM/wiki)), test scripts and test
results are also part of this repository.
